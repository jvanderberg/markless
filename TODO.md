## TODO

- Add non-modal mouse drag selection while mouse capture is enabled (map screen cells to document spans, highlight selection, copy selected text).
- Implement file watching with debounce, reload, and scroll preservation.
- Implement search (state, matching, navigation, highlighting).
- Implement configurable keybindings.
- Implement TOC collapse/expand behavior.
- Extract heading IDs from comrak `header_ids`.
- Implement proper table rendering.
- Implement syntax highlighting for code blocks.
- Implement proper list rendering with wrapping/indentation for nested items.
- Add a real markdown layout/rendering stage (wrapping, inline styles, spacing) instead of basic line coloring.
